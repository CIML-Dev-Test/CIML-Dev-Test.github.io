One of the largest technical meetings in HPC in the world is the annual Supercomputing Conference (<a href="https://supercomputing.org">https://supercomputing.org</a>). SC is where experts in High-Performance Computing (HPC) meet. HPC spans many scientific computing domains including Math, Physics, Biology, and Data and Environmental Sciences. 
SC supports many student activities, including the Student Cluster Competition (<a href="http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/">http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/</a>). SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing. Student teams must learn to design and build small cluster with support from mentors, hardware and software vendor partners, learn designated scientific applications, apply optimization techniques for their chosen architectures. At the SC conference, teams of 6 students compete against teams from all over the world, in a non-stop, 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload, keep the cluster up and running, attend conference events, and demonstrate to the judges their HPC knowledge and skills. Acceptance to the SC competition is competitive and requires intense preparation and skill development. 
<p>
<li> HPC Training Sessions, where students will learn common HPC concepts including optimization, distributed computing, cloud computing, GPU acceleration, and parallel computing. Training will be presented by SDSC staff, with the assistance of the Supercomputing Club. Those students who complete the HPC training will receive an SDSC Certificate of Completion in “HPC Training” and will be eligible to apply for the SCC team. 
This year, SDSC is sponsoring several HPC related projects for students 
with the intent of introducing them to HPC, helping them engage in HPC activities, 
and to participate in future SCC

activities (starting with SC19 in Denver).
