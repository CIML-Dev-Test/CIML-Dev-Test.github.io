<font color="red">NEWS!!! The SCC 20 is Going Virtual!</font><br>
Due to Covid-19, the annual student cluster competition will be held virtually,
and SDSC plans to participate. See below for more information, and to apply to be a member of our team.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>SDSC supports many student activities, including the
<a href="http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/">Student Cluster Competition (SCC)</a>
held at the annual <a href="https://supercomputing.org/">Supercomputing</a> meeting.
SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing.
Student teams must learn to design and build small cluster with support from mentors, hardware and
software vendor partners, learn designated scientific applications, apply optimization techniques
for their chosen architectures. At the SC conference, teams of 6 students compete against teams
from all over the world, in a non-stop, 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload,
keep the cluster up and running, attend conference events, and demonstrate to the judges their HPC knowledge
and skills. Acceptance to the SC competition is competitive and requires intense
preparation and skill development.</p>

<h3>SCC20 Competition Details</h3>
<p>
Due to the impact of Covid-19, the SC Conference is modifying the Student Cluster Competition
at SC20 in order to support remote participation. The <em>Virtual Student Cluster
  Competition (VSCC)</em>  will
be held completely in the cloud, allowing student teams to participate remotely
from their home institution, or in person at the conference. The dates of the competition are
typically held during the main SC conference (November 15â€“20), but those dates might change
slightly as the program is adapted to the new format.
</p>
<p>
The <em>VSCC</em> competition will be completely embracing the model of on-demand HPC computing
  in the cloud: as part of the competition, students will have the opportunity to build
  virtual HPC Clusters using the
  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Azure</a> cloud computing resource on
  which to run the different applications. <p>For more details about the SCC20 competition, and a list of the applications that will be run during the
  competition, visit
  <a href="https://sc20.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/student-cluster-competition/">the SCC site here.</a>
  </p>
<p>
SDSC plans to select a team of UCSD undergraduate students and a team of
mentors from both SDSC and our HPC Systems sponsors, who can work together over
the Summer and this Fall to learn to build on-demand VMs and to run the suite of
HPC applications. If this sounds like something you would be interested in
doing, please fill out an application form below by Friday, June 26th.
