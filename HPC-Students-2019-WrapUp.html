The HPC Students Program focuses on educating and training the next generation of High-Performance Computing professionals and researchers. It is designed to educate students from high school to grad school about HPC, to motivate them to pursue HPC careers, and to serve as bridge between students and HPC-related research and researchers. 
This Spring, several efforts were launched, including:
<ul>
<li> Sponsoring the formation of the <a href="http://supercomputingclub.ucsd.edu/">UCSD Supercomputing Club</a>: including providing meeting room space and supercomputer accounts; hosting a lab space for the club</li>
<li>HPC Training Sessions</a>: a 10 week training session in HPC, resulting in Co-Curricular Record Credit</li>
<li>Formation of a Summer cluster buildout team: in progress</li>
<li>Connecting students to help update a Raspberry PI cluster
<li>Preparation for student cluster competition teams (next one due in November for the International Supercomputing Conference, Frankfurt, Germany)
