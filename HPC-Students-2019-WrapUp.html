This year, SDSC is sponsoring two initiatives, HPC Students Program and 
the UCSD Supercomputing Club, with the intent of introducing students to HPC,  
helping them engage in HPC activities, and to participate in future SCC 
activities (starting with SC19 in Denver).
This Spring, we will be holding HPC Training Sessions, where students will learn common HPC concepts including optimization, distributed computing, cloud computing, GPU acceleration, and parallel computing. Training will be presented by SDSC staff, with the assistance of the Supercomputing Club. Those students who complete the HPC training will receive an SDSC Certificate of Completion in “HPC Training” and will be eligible to apply for the SCC team. 
 A small group of students will have the opportunity to travel to SCC’19 (all expenses paid) and have the experience of a lifetime.
