## Who are we?

We are the UCSD Supercomputing Club. We exist to provide an open and inclusive environment for UCSD students to learn and develop the skills of the High Performance Computing industry. Our goal is to make the knowledge and technology surrounding this industry accessible to students of all majors and backgrounds.
The Supercomputing club collaborates with and is sponsored by the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) through the High Performance Computing Students Program. To learn more about the HPC-Students initiative, please see: [HPC Students Program](https://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/hpc_students.html).

### Why HPC?

The field of High Performance Computing spans many domains outside in Scientific Computing including Applied Math, Physics, Biology, and Data and Environmental Sciences.
We are continuing to develop content to educate our club members in concepts common in HPC, including optimization, distributed computing, cloud computing, containers, GPU acceleration, and parallel code at scale. In order to do this, we have curated a series of in-person workshops as well as 'crash course' style videos on [our YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgKelmfwqf5NffobCGXAcLg?)

We also aim to help SDSC build a team of students to compete in Student Cluster Competitions around the world. Last year's US competition, held at the annual supercomputing [SC'18](https://sc18.supercomputing.org) meeting in Dallas, challenged students to build, run, and optimize applications that included Deep Learning, Monte Carlo approximations, weather forecasting, and earthquake simulation.

For more information on the SDSCs' SCC team training plans, see the [SCC Information Page](https://training.sdsc.edu/scc")

### Who do we seek?

It is our firm belief that the most important qualities of members (and students in general!) are curiosity and motivation.
Most of the necessary skills can be taught with a relatively gentle learning curve, regardless of your major.

If any of these are true of you, you're in the right place!
- You want to participate in building and optimizing a supercomputer
- You'd like to execute code on the fastest computers in the world
- You enjoy working with the Linux Command Line
- Belonging to an inclusive technology focused community on campus appeals to you

We'd love your help getting this club the platform and reach it - and you as students - deserve.
It won't be the same without you.

### How do I get involved?

Starting July 2nd, our Summer Session meetings will be on Tuesdays at 9am in SDSC Conference Room 567. Contact us if you need directions or if you are interested in attending remotely!
