The UCSD Co-Curricular Record (CCR) (https://elt.ucsd.edu/ccr/index.html) highlights student achievements in opportunities beyond the classroom including a brief description and the skills developed on an official record. The purpose of the CCR is to demonstrate the value of engaging in opportunities beyond the classroom, and to help students reflect on and articulate the competencies and skills they developed.
