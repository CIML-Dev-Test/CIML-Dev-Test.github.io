The <a href="https://www.sdsc.edu">San Diego Supercomputer Center</a> and HPC Students are pleased to annouce the SDSC Co-Curriccular Record (SDSC-CCR) Program. The program will facilitate awarding CCR credits to SDSC students and interns for activities that they are working on with SDSC and its collaborators.
<p>
The UCSD Co-Curricular Record (CCR) 
(<a href="https://elt.ucsd.edu/ccr">https://elt.ucsd.edu/ccr</a>)
 highlights student achievements in opportunities beyond the classroom including a brief description and the skills developed on an official record. The purpose of the CCR is to demonstrate the value of engaging in opportunities beyond the classroom, and to help students reflect on and articulate the competencies and skills they developed. 
For a list of currently approved CCR activities, see <a href="https://elt.ucsd.edu/ccr/ccrapprovedopportunities.html">https://elt.ucsd.edu/ccr/index.html</a>.
<p>
The HPC Students Program has been working with the UCSD Co-Curricular Record team to create a system where SDSC staff and researchers can grant Co-Curricular Record credit to thier students. SDSC currently has one approved CCR (<a href="https://elt.ucsd.edu/ccr/ccrapprovedopportunities.html#San-Diego-Supercomputer-Center-">San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), Research Affairs Intern</a>), and 3 pending (related to HPC Training activities). In addition, we plan to work with SDSC staff and collaborators to create more CCRs that are customized to the student activities. 
<p>
If you are a student, contact your SDSC mentor or supervisor and verify that you are eligible for the SDSC CCR listed above. Then go to the 
<a href="https://elt.ucsd.edu/ccr/get-recognized.html#My-opportunity-is-CCR-Approved">How Do I Get Recognized on the CCR page"</a> and follow the instructions.
