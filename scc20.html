    <b> SC Student Cluster Competition Team/b></li>
    SDSC supports many student activities, including the
    (<a href="http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/">http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/</a>).
    SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing.
    Student teams must learn to design and build small cluster with support from mentors, hardware and
    software vendor partners, learn designated scientific applications, apply optimization techniques
    for their chosen architectures. At the SC conference, teams of 6 students compete against teams
    from all over the world, in a non-stop, 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload,
    keep the cluster up and running, attend conference events, and demonstrate to the judges their HPC knowledge
    and skills. Acceptance to the SC competition is competitive and requires intense preparation and skill development.
