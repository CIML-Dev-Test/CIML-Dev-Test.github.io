# UCSD Supercomputing Club 

### Who are we?

We are the UCSD Supercomputing Club. This club exists to provide exposure to Supercomputers and High-Performance Computing to interested students. It is a club formed by students and run by students.
The Supercomputing club is also a collaboration between University of California students who are members of the Supercomputing Club and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) High Performance Computing Students (HPC-Students) Program. To learn more about HPC Students, please see: [HPC Students Program](https://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/hpc_students.html).

Learn more about the club, visit our new club site:<br>

### What are our goals?

The field of High-Performance Computing (HPC) spans many domains outside in Scientific Computing including Applied Math, Physics, Biology, and Data and Environmental Sciences.
We plan to help club members learn concepts common in HPC, including optimization, distributed computing, cloud computing, containers, GPU acceleration, and parallel code at scale.

The club is dedicated to supporting student interests, so we have formed a few special interest groups (SIGs), including: Systems (HPC clusters, admin); Big Data; Scientific Computing and Simulations; and others.

We also aim to help SDSC to build a team of students to compete in Student Cluster Competitions around the world.  Last year's US competition, held at the annual supercomputing [SC'18](https://sc18.supercomputing.org) meeting in Dallas, challenged students to build, run, and optimize applications that included Deep Learning,
Monte Carlo approximations, weather forecasting, and earthquake simulation. 

One of the students starting the Supercomputing Club participated in the sc18 Student Cluster Competition with their community college. Additionally, a staff member at San Diego Supercomputer Center participated twice previously with a team from San Diego State University. They are both eager to help another team do the same this Fall at SCâ€™19 in Denver, Colorado.

For more information on the SDSCs' SCC team training plans, see the [SCC Information Page](https://training.sdsc.edu/scc")

### Who do we seek?

It is our firm belief that the most important quality of prospective members is motivation;
most of the necessary skills can be taught with a relatively gentle learning curve.

You are especially encouraged to apply if any of these are true of you:
- You want to participate in building and optimizing a supercomputer
- You'd like to execute code on the fastest computers in the world
- You enjoy working with the Linux Command Line
- Belonging to an inclusive technology focused community on campus appeals to you.

We'd love your help getting this club off the ground.
It won't be the same without you.

### How do I get involved?

We held an info session at San Diego Supercomputer Center on January 18th, 2019. If you missed that meeting, our next meeting will be held on Friday, April 5th at 3:30 pm.
You're invited to come see the supercomputers, learn more about the club.

Please fill out the form in the link to RSVP and tell us a bit about yourself.
