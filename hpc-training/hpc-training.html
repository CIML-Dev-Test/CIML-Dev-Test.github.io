<h3>Description of the Program:</h3>
SDSC supports the training of its user community, including students,
in all aspects of High-performance computing (HPC).

SDSC supports training of its user community, including students (grad/undergrad), collaborators, staff, in all aspects of High-performance computing (HPC). For high-school students, please check out the <a href="https://http://education.sdsc.edu/studenttech/?page_id=657">SDSC Research Experience for High School Students (REHS)</a> program.

 We have planned a series of training sessions, to be held on Fridays from 1:00pm to 3:00pm in the SDSC SynCenter (or the Auditorium, if needed) that will introduce participants to a variety of HPC topics and skill development activities, including:

<ul>
<li>Basic Skills and using Jupyter Notebooks.</li>
<li>HPC architecture & software.</li>
<li>Cloud Computing.</li>
<li>Parallel programming basics, including GPU/CUDA, OpenMP and MPI using Python, C, Fortran, and possibly other languages.</li>
<li>Performance characterization of the cluster, numerical methods, and other applications.</li>
<li>Visualization and analysis of big data sets.</li>
<li>Machine learning fundamentals.</li>
</ul>

<h3> How the Training Sessions Work</h3>
<p>
Participants will be given accounts on <a href="https://expanse.sdsc.edu/">Expanse</a>, the newest SDSC Supercomputer, and will be given the opportunity to complete several basic assignments. Participants who successfully complete the HPC Training program will receive an <em>SDSC Certificate of Completion in HPC Training</em>. Students who complete the course will also be eligible to receive [UCSD Co-Curricular Credit]() for their efforts. There is no grade in the course. To sucessfully complete the course, participants must attendi most of the sessions and complete approximately 80% of the work. Participants are encouraged to work as teams, and can work on the assignments past the last date of training sessions with the approval of the instructor.
