<h3>Description of the Program:</h3>
SDSC supports training of its user community, including students (grad/undergrad), collaborators, staff,
in all aspects of High-performance computing (HPC) through webinars, workshops and institutes (see 
<a href="https://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/training_hpc.html">Training for Advanced Computing Users</a>). 

Since 2019, we have held a series of HPC user training sessions, which are targeted towards UCSD undergraduates, 
with a focus towards building a team for the annual <a 
href="https://sc21.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/student-cluster-competition/">Student Cluster Competition</a>, 
held in conjunction with the <a href="https://sc21.supercomputing.org/">International Conference for High 
  Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC)</a> meeting.
The program is also popular with researchers and staff within the UC system, so we have begun to expand participation to include these groups.
For high-school students, please check out the
<a href="https://http://education.sdsc.edu/studenttech/?page_id=657">SDSC Research Experience for High School Students (REHS)</a>
program.
<p>
The sessions are designed to introduce participants to a variety of HPC topics and skill development activities, including:<br>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Skills and using Jupyter Notebooks.</li>
<li>HPC architecture & software.</li>
<li>Parallel programming basics, including GPU/CUDA, OpenMP and MPI using Python, C, Fortran, and possibly other languages.</li>
<li>Performance characterization of the cluster, numerical methods, and other applications.</li>
<li>Visualization and analysis of big data sets.</li>
<li>Cloud Computing.</li>
<li>HPC Application overview: Benchmarking and Machine learning fundamentals.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3> How the Training Sessions Work</h3>
<p>
Participants will be given accounts on <a href="https://expanse.sdsc.edu/">Expanse</a>, the newest SDSC 
Supercomputer, and will be given the opportunity to complete several basic assignments.  
There is no grade in the course: to sucessfully complete the course, participants must attend most of the 
  sessions and complete approximately 80% of the work. Participants are encouraged to work as teams, 
  and can work on the assignments past the last date of Spring quarter, with the approval of the instructor.
Participants who successfully complete the HPC Training program will receive an <em>SDSC Certificate of Completion in HPC Training</em>. 
 Students who complete the course will also be eligible to receive 
  <a href="https://hpc-students.sdsc.edu/sdsc_ccr">SDSC/UCSD Co-Curricular Credits</a> for their efforts 
  and to be considered to be a member of <a href="https://hpc-students.sdsc.edu/scc">Student Cluster Competition Team</a>.
