    <b> SC Student Cluster Competition Team</b><a name="scc20"></a>
    SDSC supports many student activities, including the
    (<a href="http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/">http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/</a>).
    SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing.
    Student teams must learn to design and build small cluster with support from mentors, hardware and
    software vendor partners, learn designated scientific applications, apply optimization techniques
    for their chosen architectures. At the SC conference, teams of 6 students compete against teams
    from all over the world, in a non-stop, 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload,
    keep the cluster up and running, attend conference events, and demonstrate to the judges their HPC knowledge
    and skills. Acceptance to the SC competition is competitive and requires intense preparation and skill development.

    <b><a href="https://hpc-students.sdsc.edu/hpc_training">HPC User Training:</a></b><a name="hpc_training"></a> This is an annual, 10 session course. Participants will learn common HPC concepts including
    optimization, distributed computing, cloud computing, GPU acceleration, and parallel computing.
    Training is presented by SDSC staff and collaborators Those students who complete the HPC training will
    receive an SDSC Certificate of Completion in â€œHPC Training." The next session begins in January, 2021.
     More information about HPC Training can be found <a href="">here</a>.

  <li><b><a href="https://hpc-students.sdsc.edu/scc20">Cluster build-out team (Raspberry Pi and other architectures):</a>(/pi_cluster)</b><a name="pi_cluser"></a> Students will work together to build a 16 or 32 node PI cluster.
      (Project starting in Spring Quarter, 2021.

  <li><b>[SDSC Students@Supercomputing:]
    (https://sc20.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/)</b>

    <a name="students-at-sc"></a>
    One of the largest technical meetings in HPC in the world is the annual Supercomputing Conference
    (<a href="https://supercomputing.org">https://supercomputing.org</a>). SC is where experts in
    High-Performance Computing (HPC) meet. HPC spans many scientific computing domains including
    Math, Physics, Biology, and Data and Environmental Sciences. <br>
    SDSC will sponsor qualified student applications for: Student Volunteers;
    the Student Cluster Competition team; and the new #HPCImmersion Program. Get your application started today.
