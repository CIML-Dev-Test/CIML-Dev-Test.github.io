The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) and UC San Diego is putting together a team to compete in the Student Cluster Competition (SCC), held at the annual Supercomputing conference SC21 in St. Louis, Missouri.  SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing.  The SCC teams consist of 6 students who will design and build a small cluster with support from mentors and hardware and software vendor partners.  They will learn designated scientific applications and apply optimization techniques for their chosen architectures. SCC teams compete against teams from around the world, in a non-stop 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload, while keeping the cluster up and running, and demonstrating to the judges their HPC skills and knowledge.  All team members are invited to attend the conference. Last years SCC20 team placed 4th/19 teams in the overall competition. Check out this news article on the team!
