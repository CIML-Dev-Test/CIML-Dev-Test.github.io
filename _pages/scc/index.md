<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>SDSC supports many student activities, including the
<a href="http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/">Student Cluster Competition (SCC)</a>
held at the annual <a href="https://supercomputing.org/">Supercomputing</a> meeting.
SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing.
SCC competition teams consist of 6 students who  must learn to design and
build small cluster with support from mentors, hardware and
software vendor partners, learn designated scientific applications, apply optimization techniques
for their chosen architectures. At the SC conference, teams of 6 students compete against teams
from all over the world, in a non-stop, 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload,
keep the cluster up and running, attend conference events, and demonstrate to the judges their HPC knowledge
and skills. Acceptance to the SC competition is competitive and requires intense
preparation and skill development.</p>
