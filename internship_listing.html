<h3>2020 Training Schedule</h3> 

<h4>Summer Internships in Parallel Computational Sciences (SIParCS)</h4>
Due January 1, 2020<Br>
Paid internships for undergraduates and graduates at the National Center for Atmospheric 
 Research (NCAR) facility in Boulder, CO. Projects cover topics such as augmented reality, 
 machine learning, analysis of climate and weather model data, and more.<br>
Apply: http://tiny.cc/SIParCS<Br>
 
<h4>Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates (DREU)</h4>
Due January 15, 2020<br>
DREU is a highly selective program that matches students with a faculty mentor 
 for a summer research experience at the faculty mentor’s home institution. DREU interns 
 have the opportunity to be directly involved in a research project in computing and 
 interact with graduate students and professors on a daily basis. This experience 
 is invaluable for those who are considering graduate school.<br>

<h4>DesignSafe-CI Research 4 Social Change Research Experience for Undergraduates</h4>
Due February 1, 2020<br>
Paid, 10-week summer research program at various NHERI multi-hazard engineering sites. 
 The NHERI REU program is dedicated to helping undergraduate students experience multi-hazard 
 engineering as well as cyber infrastructure, data management, and simulation sites. Hands-on, 
 research based projects introduce participants to a network of engineers, scientists, and students 
 working toward mitigating the effects of natural hazards.<br>
