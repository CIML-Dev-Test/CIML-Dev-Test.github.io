### Who are we?

A program for educating and training the next generation of HPC professionals and researchers
The HPC Students Program focuses on educating and training the next generation of High-Performance Computing professionals and researchers. It is designed to educate students from high school to grad school about HPC, to motivate them to pursue HPC careers, and to serve as bridge between students and HPC-related research and researchers. The program initially works with UCSD undergraduates, and will be expanded to include other groups as time and budget permits.

The program is committed to sponsoring and supporting student activities through funding and providing of resources. This includes:

* Interaction and outreach to UCSD Clubs, including the newly formed UCSD Supercomputing Club (HPC-Students)
* Support and advocacy for students applying to HPC related activities including applications for graduate school, grants, support to travel to meetings, etc.
* HPC Training course for UCSD undergraduate and graduate students (https://training.sdsc.edu/scc)
* Increased student participation at conferences & meetings, including local, national, and international
* Hosting student focused training workshops/bootcamps/hackathons/material for students
* Mentoring and sponsoring competitive teams, such as the annual Student Cluster Competition
* Support of SDSC and NSF broader engagement goals
