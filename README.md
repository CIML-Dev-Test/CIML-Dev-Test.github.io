### Who are we?

The Student Cluster Club is a planned collaboration between San Diego Supercomputer Center and University of California, 
San Diego.

### What is our goal?

This club exists to provide exposure to Supercomputers and High Performance Computing to interested students.
Secondarily, we aim to build a team of students to compete in Student Cluster Competitions around the world.

### Who do we seek?

Supercomputing has applications to many domains including efficient computation, xparallel computing, cloud computing,
modeling, data science, deep learning, and applied mathematics.
It is our firm belief that the most important quality of prospective members is motivation;
most of the necessary skills can be taught with a relatively gentle learning curve.
If any of those areas pique your interest, we're looking for you.
You are especially encouraged to apply if any of these are true of you:
- You enjoy working with the Linux Command Line
- You find building and optimizing computers interesting
- You'd like to execute code on the fastest computers in the world.
- Belonging to an inclusive technology focused community on campus is appealing.
