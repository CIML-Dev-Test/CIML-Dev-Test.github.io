### Who are we?

The Student Cluster Club is a planned collaboration between San Diego Supercomputer Center and the University of California, 
San Diego.

### What is our goal?

This club exists to provide exposure to Supercomputers and High Performance Computing to interested students.
Secondarily, we aim to build a team of students to compete in Student Cluster Competitions around the world.

### Who do we seek?

Supercomputing has applications to many domains including efficient computation, parallel computing, cloud computing,
modeling, data science, deep learning, and applied mathematics.
It is our firm belief that the most important quality of prospective members is motivation;
most of the necessary skills can be taught with a relatively gentle learning curve.
If any of those areas pique your interest, we're looking for you.
You are especially encouraged to apply if any of these are true of you:
- You enjoy working with the Linux Command Line
- You find building and optimizing computers interesting
- You'd like to execute code on the fastest computers in the world
- Belonging to an inclusive technology focused community on campus is appealing

We'd love your help getting this club off the ground. 
It won't be the same without you.

## More on the Student Cluster Competition

From [sc19.org](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/student-cluster-competition/):
> "The Student Cluster Competition (SCC) was developed in 2007 to provide an immersive high performance computing experience to undergraduate and high school students. 
> With sponsorship from hardware and software vendor partners, student teams design and build small clusters, 
> learn scientific applications, apply optimization techniques for their chosen architectures, and compete in a non-stop, 
> 48-hour challenge at the SC conference to complete a real-world scientific workload, 
> showing off their HPC knowledge for conference attendees and judges."

One of the students starting this club participated in the sc18 Student Cluster Competition at their community college.
They are eager to help another team do the same this fall in Denver, Colorado.
