### Who are we?

The Student Cluster Club is a planned collaboration between San Diego Supercomputer Center and University of California, San Diego.


### What is our goal?

This club exists to provide exposure to Supercomputers and High Performance Computing to interested students.
Secondarily, we aim to build a team of students to compete in Student Cluster Competitions around the world.
