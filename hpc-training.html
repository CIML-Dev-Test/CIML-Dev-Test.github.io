<h2> Training Program</h2>
<font color="0A188B">
<h3>HPC Training Sessions Scheduled for January 10, 2020 through March 13, 2020 </h3>
</font>
SDSC supports the training of its user community, including students, 
in all aspects of High-performance computing (HPC). The goal of the
training is to prepare new HPC users to run jobs on HPC systems. For 
more advanced training, please see our <a 
href="https://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/training.html">webinars 
  and workshops</a> which are targeted to more experienced users.

The scope of the training effort includes several skill development 
activities, including:
<ul>
   <li> HPC architectures, software, and admin skills.  </li>
   <li> Basics of parallel programming, including MPI using C, Fortran, and possibly other languages.  </li>
   <li> How to run HPC applications in the areas of performance characterization of the cluster, bioinformatics, numerical methods, password security, and other applications.  </li>
   <li> Visualization and analysis of big data sets.  </li>
</ul>
Participants will be given accounts on <a href="https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html">Comet</a>, the SDSC Supercomputer, and be given the opportunity to complete several basic assignments. Students who successfully complete the HPC Training program will receive an <em>SDSC Certificate of Completion in HPC Training</em>
