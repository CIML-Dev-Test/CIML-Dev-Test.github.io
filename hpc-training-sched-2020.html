SDSC supports training of its user community, including students, in all aspects of High-performance computing (HPC). We have planned a series of training sessions, to be held on Fridays from 1:00pm to 3:00pm in the SDSC SynCenter (or the Auditorium, if needed). Note: this schedule is based on the Spring, 2019 HPC Training session. 
  There will be another training session starting in January, 2020. The scope of the training effort includes several skill development activities, including:
<ul>
   <li> Study HPC architectures, software, and admin skills.  </li>
   <li> Learn the basics of parallel programming, including MPI using C, Fortran, and possibly other languages.  </li>
   <li> Running HPC applications in the areas of performance characterization of the cluster, bioinformatics, numerical methods, password security, and other applications.  </li>
   <li> Visualization and analysis of big data sets.  </li>
   <li> Work as a team to develop and work on the items above.  </li>
</ul>
Students will be given accounts on <a http="https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html">Comet</a>, the SDSC Supercomputer, and be given the opportunity to complete several basic assignments. Students who successfully complete the HPC Training program will receive an <em>SDSC Certificate of Completion in HPC Training</em>, and will become eligible to apply to be on the SCC Core team. Note: the final SCC team who will travel to the competition will be chosen from this group.
