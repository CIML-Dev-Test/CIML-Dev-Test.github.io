<h3>Description of the Program:</h3>
<b>SDSC</b> supports training of its user community, including students, collaborators, staff, in all aspects of High-performance computing (HPC). We have planned a series of training sessions, to be held on Fridays from 1:00pm to 3:00pm in the SDSC SynCenter (or the Auditorium, if needed) that will introduce participants to a variety of HPC topics and skill development activities, including:
<ul>
   <li> Basic Linux and using Jupyter Notebooks.</li>
   <li> HPC architectures, software, and admin skills.  </li>
   <li> Parallel programming basics, including GPU/CUDE, OpenMP and MPI using Python, C, Fortran, and possibly other languages.  </li>
   <li> Performance characterization of the cluster, numerical methods, and other applications.  </li>
   <li> Visualization and analysis of big data sets.</li>
   <li> Machine learning fundamentals.</li>
   <li> Work as a team to develop and work on the items above.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How the training sessions work</h3>
Students will be given accounts on <a http="https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html">Comet</a>, the SDSC Supercomputer, and be given the opportunity to complete several basic assignments. Students who successfully complete the HPC Training program will receive an <em>SDSC Certificate of Completion in HPC Training</em>, and will become eligible to apply to be on the SCC Core team. Note: the final SCC team who will travel to the competition will be chosen from this group.
