# About the Student Cluster Competition

SDSC supports many student activities, including the [Student Cluster Competition (SCC)](http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/) held at the annual [Supercomputing](https://supercomputing.org/) meeting.
SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing.
At the SC conference, teams of 6 students compete against teams from all over the world, in a non-stop, 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload, keep the cluster up and running, attend conference events, and demonstrate to the judges their HPC knowledge and skills.
SCC students must learn to design and build small cluster with support from mentors, hardware and software vendor partners, learn designated scientific applications, apply optimization techniques for their chosen architectures.
Acceptance to the SC competition is competitive and requires intense preparation and skill development.
